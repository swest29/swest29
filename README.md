## Hi there, my name is Sarina West!
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
<p> I am currently a Junior at ASU. My major is Graphic Information Technology with a focus in User Experience.</p>

<p> I am always open to learning new things and continously trying to improve my skills. I hope to one day fulfill my ultimate goal of working in the gaming industry, as it would be a dream of mine to play a role in creating player-centric experiences. But for now I am focusing on my education and further building my portfollio so that I can pursue an internship in the near future.</p>
<p>Outside of school and code, I am extremely passionate about anything gaming, music and art.
